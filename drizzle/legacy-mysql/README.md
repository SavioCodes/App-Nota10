# Legacy MySQL Migrations (Archive)

These files are kept only for historical traceability from the pre-PostgreSQL phase.

- They are not part of the active migration path anymore.
- Current baseline migration is generated for PostgreSQL in `drizzle/0000_nebulous_betty_ross.sql`.
- Runtime DB sync uses `corepack pnpm db:push` (`drizzle-kit push`).
